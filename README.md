# tome-db

WIP

Read about implementation specifics [here](https://github.com/holium/bounties/blob/main/tome-db.md).

Frontend exists at `http://localhost:3000/apps/tome-db/`

Desk is called `%tome`, starter agent is `%tome-api`

Visit [here](https://www.ajlamarc.com/blog/2022-11-19-urbit-setup/) to see 
more on how this was set up / how to run locally on a fakezod.

If you are running on a platform besides linux, your ship URL might
be different than `http://localhost:8080/`.  Verify and put the correct
URL in `.env.local`.
